# Gemini-Emotion-Based-Study-Tool

## Description
Emotion based study tool that uses Google's Gemini to analyze the user and suggest music based off mood and attention. 

## Origin
This idea originated while competing in SteelHacks XI with my teammates Gresyon Barsotti and Owen Finucan. About 7 hours in, we pivoted to this idea when I suggested it while we were getting food, and my team helped to grow the idea to what it is now. While all this code in this repo is mine, they definitely deserve credit for fleshing out the idea.
